# Lab-Oct-31


### IMPORTANT: if you want, I have some coding learning for y'all for lab on Oct 31! 

#### PyQt5 Resources

Our app relies on the library **PyQt5** -- my favorite tutorial is linked [here!](https://www.pythonguis.com/pyqt5-tutorial/)

This will link to a list of video tutorials if that's your thing -- I personally prefer reading and working through it on my own machine. This website has those kinds of tutorials as well! Start [here,](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/creating-your-first-pyqt-window/), working all the way through the _PyQt5 Layouts_ section.

These will explain the basics of how our app works! I found that the hardest part of getting onboard with another project was understanding the libraries it worked on. It does a lot of the heavy lifting for us, and our code won't really make sense trying to read it without it!
